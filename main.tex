\section{Background: Abelian Groups, \texorpdfstring{$K$}{K}-Vector Spaces, and \texorpdfstring{$R$}{R}-Modules}

\begin{frame}{Abelian Groups}
    Before we take a look at abelian categories, we
    need to introduce the algebraic structure they
    all rely on: \textbf{abelian groups}. \medskip

    \begin{definition}[Abelian group]
        An abelian group $(G, +)$ is a commutative monoid
        which allows inverses.
    \end{definition}

    Although abelian groups are fairly simple objects compared to
    a non-commutative groups, they
    appear everywhere: $\ZZ$ and the integers modulo $n$ form
    an abelian group with addition, and all vector spaces rely on
    abelian groups for their additive structure.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Rings and Modules I}
    In fact, the connection between vector spaces and abelian groups is
    deeper than what it initially appears to be. In order to show this,
    let us recall the definition of a \textbf{ring} and of a \textbf{module}.

    \begin{definition}[Ring]
        A ring is a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$
        such that $(R, +)$ is an abelian
        group, $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid and law of distributivity applies, i.e.
        for any choice of $a$, $b$, $c \in R$
        \[
            a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c,
        \]
        \[
            (a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c.
        \]
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Rings and Modules II}
    \begin{definition}[$R$-module]
        Given a ring $R$, we say that a set $A$ equipped with a binary operation $+$ is an $R$-module with
        scalar multiplication $\cdot$ if:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $(A, +)$ is an abelian group,
            \item $1 \cdot a = a$, where $1$ is the unity of the ring $R$ and $a \in A$,
            \item $\lambda \cdot (\mu \cdot a) = (\lambda \cdot \mu) \cdot a$, for each $\lambda$, $\mu \in R$, and $a \in A$, 
            \item $(\lambda + \mu) \cdot a = \lambda \cdot a + \mu \cdot a$ for each $\lambda$, $\mu \in R$, and $a \in A$,
            \item $\lambda \cdot (a + b) = \lambda \cdot a + \lambda \cdot b$ for each $\lambda \in R$, and $a$, $b \in A$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Abelian Groups as \texorpdfstring{$\ZZ$}{â„¤}-Modules}
    In this setting, $K$-vector spaces are simply $K$-modules and abelian groups
    are simply $\ZZ$-modules with the following scalar multiplication:
    \[
        k \cdot g \triangleq \begin{cases}
            \underbrace{g + \ldots + g}_{k \text{ times}} & k \geq 0 \\
            -(-k) \cdot g & k < 0.
        \end{cases}
    \] \smallskip

    Modules are indeed a great unifying concept for these two algebraic structure, and we'll see
    at the end of the presentation that the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem will
    give us more reasons to believe so.

% Origins and Motivation of Abelian Categories

\section{Origins and Motivation of Abelian Categories}

\begin{frame}{Historical Notes}
    In 1945 two mathematicians, Eilenberg and Mac Lane, wrote for the
    first time about categories in the way we look at them now. \medskip
    
    They were looking to
    deeply understand \textit{natural transformations}, hence they had
    to deal with functors and categories first. Their goal was to
    apply such abstractness to homological algebra, which revolves
    around \textbf{chain complexes}. \medskip

    Understanding chain complexes allow mathematicians to retrieve
    topological invariants from geometrical structures in a pure
    algebraic setting.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Chain Complexes}
    Chain complexes are particular concatenations of morphisms in $\cat{Ab}$, the
    category of abelian groups, written as seen below
    \[\begin{tikzcd}[sep=large, ampersand replacement=\&]
        {C_1} \& {C_2} \& \ldots \& {C_n}
        \arrow["{d_1}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["{d_2}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["{d_{n-1}}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    where $d_{i+1} \circ d_i = 0$ for each $i$ (i.e., $\im d_i \subseteq \ker d_{i+1}$). \smallskip

    We say that such a chain complex is \textbf{exact} whenever $\im d_i$ is exactly
    $\ker d_{i+1}$ for each $i$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Historical Notes II}
    The goal of abelian categories is to provide the most general setting to
    generalise and make use of chain complexes. \medskip
    
    Instances of the definition of abelian
    categories are first found in a paper from 1955 by Buchsbaum, whereas further
    foundations of the theory were laid in a famous paper from
    Grothendieck later in 1957. \medskip

    The goal of this presentation is to derive the modern setting of
    abelian categories from scratch.
\end{frame}

% Derivation of Abelian Categories
%%%

\section{Derivation of Abelian Categories}

\begin{frame}{Steps to Define Abelian Categories}
    In order to derive a correct definition for
    abelian categories, we need to address the following issues:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We must allow for the existance of ``zero morphisms'',
            since we want $d_{i+1} \circ d_i = 0$.
        \item We must allow some structure for the hom-sets, as
            group homomorphisms between two abelian groups $A$ and
            $B$ form an abelian group as well.
        \item We need to define kernels in a pure categorical sense,
            since $\ker f$ is defined in a set-theoretic manner. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Zero objects I}
    Abelian groups, vector spaces, and modules in general have a peculiar property: \textit{initial objects and
    final objects are the same!} \medskip
    
    In both cases, such initial object is always
    denoted as the ``trivial'' or ``zero'' object, since it always induces a
    ``trivial'' morphism with respect to another module.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Zero objects II}
    Hence it is crucial to give a proper definition for \textbf{zero objects}: \medskip
    
    \begin{definition}[Zero object]
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. We say $0$ is a
        zero object if it's both an initial and
        a final object.
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Zero morphisms I}
    As anticipated, zero objects also allow for the
    definition of zero morphisms, which will be regarded as the
    ``trivial morphism'' from $A$ to $B$ (e.g., sending all elements
    of $A$ into a ``null element'', if the category is a concrete and
    algebraic one). \medskip

    We derive a definition for zero morphisms
    by combining the existance and uniqueness of initial and finals morphisms
    with respect to $0$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Zero morphisms II}
    \begin{definition}[Zero morphisms]
        Let $A$ and $B$ be two objects and let $0$ be a zero
        object of $\mathcal{C}$. Then we define $0_{AB}$ as
        follows
        \[
            0_{AB} \triangleq \, ?_{B} \, \circ \, !_{A}, \qquad \text{where} \quad ?_B : 0 \to B, \quad\; !_A : A \to 0.
        \]
    \end{definition}

    The definition is independent of the zero object $0$ and is
    in this sense ``unique''.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Enrichment of \texorpdfstring{$\cat{RMod}$}{RMod} over \texorpdfstring{$\cat{Ab}$}{Ab}}
    Hom-sets of the form $\hom(V, W)$ in $\cat{Ab}$ (and $\cat{RMod}$, the category
    of $R$-modules) have an additional
    structure: they are not just a set, they have a natural structure
    of abelian group as well! \medskip

    We can sum morphisms ($f + g$), $0_{VW}$ is indeed the unity,
    and the sum behave
    ``bilinearly'' with respect to the composition ($\circ$):
    \[
        (f + g) \circ h = f \circ h + g \circ h,
    \]
    \[
        f \circ (g + h) = f \circ g + f \circ h.
    \]

    This gives rise to an important definition...
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preadditive Categories}
    \begin{definition}[Preadditive category]
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. We say that $\mathcal{C}$
        is a \textbf{preadditive category} if each hom-set in
        $\mathcal{C}$ is an abelian group onto which the composition of
        morphisms acts bilinearly.
    \end{definition}

    In short, a preadditive category is such that its morphisms can
    be added and subtracted in a way that respects composition.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{(Co)products in Preadditive Categories}
    Products and coproducts behave in the same way in a
    pre-additive category, as shown below. \smallskip

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a preadditive category. Then
        products and coproducts are isomorphic to one
        another in $\mathcal{C}$.
    \end{proposition}

    We only prove that products are also coproducts; the other part of
    the statement is proved similarly.
\end{frame}

            Let $A$ and $B$ be two objects in $\mathcal{C}$ and
            let $C := A \times B$ equipped with projections
            $\pi_A$, $\pi_B : C \to A, B$ be a product of
            $A$ and $B$. \medskip
            
            We shall determine two morphisms
            $\iota_A : A \to C$ and $\iota_B : B \to C$ such that
            $(C, \iota_A, \iota_B)$ is also a coproduct of $A$ and
            $B$. \medskip

            In doing so, we strive to get some ``injections'' of $A$ and $B$
            into $C$.
        }

        \only<2>{
            A way of doing that is to use the universal
            property of $C$ and extend the following morphisms
            to two morphisms $\iota_A$, $\iota_B : A, \, B \to C$:

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $\id_A$, $0_{AB} \leadsto \iota_A$,
                \item $0_{BA}$, $\id_B \leadsto \iota_B$.
            \end{enumerate}

        \only<3>{
        $\iota_A$ and $\iota_B$ yield the following commutative diagram:

        \[\begin{tikzcd}[sep=large, ampersand replacement=\&]

        \end{tikzcd}\]
        }

        \only<4>{
        Let's now prove that $(C, \iota_A, \iota_B)$ is a coproduct. Let
        $D$ be an object from $\mathcal{C}$ and let $f$, $g : A$, $B \to D$
        be morphisms. \medskip

        Let's define $h_{f, g} : C \to D$ such that:
        \[
            h_{f, g} = f \circ \pi_A + g \circ \pi_B. 
        \]

        $h_{f, g}$ will play the role of the ``connecting morphism'' from
        $C$ to $D$.
        }

        \only<5>{
        We then expect that $h_{\iota_A, \iota_B}$ -- the
        connecting morphism generated by the ``injections'' -- will behave
        as the identity on $C$. \medskip


        Since the following identities hold:
        \begin{eqnarray*}
            \pi_A \circ h_{\iota_A, \iota_B} = \pi_A \circ (\iota_A \circ \pi_A + \iota_B \circ \pi_B) = \pi_A, \\
            \pi_B \circ h_{\iota_A, \iota_B} = \pi_B \circ (\iota_A \circ \pi_A + \iota_B \circ \pi_B) = \pi_B.
        \end{eqnarray*}
        then $h_{\iota_A, \iota_B}$ is indeed $\id_C$ by the universal property of the product.
        }

        \only<6>{
        Let's now prove that $h_{f, g}$ is the unique morphism which makes the following diagram commute:

        Commutativity can easily be proved by hand, since $0_{AB}$ and $0_{BA}$ are the zeroes of
        $\hom(A, B)$ and $\hom(B, A)$, respectively. \smallskip

        On the other hand, uniqueness is proved as follows:
        \begin{eqnarray*}
            h_{f, g} - h'
            &=& (h_{f, g} - h') \circ h_{\iota_A, \iota_B} \\

\begin{frame}{(Co)kernels in Category Theory I}
    We're missing just two ingredients for the definition of pre-abelian categories:
    \textbf{kernels} and \textbf{cokernels}. Let's derive kernels from an example,
    and cokernels will be defined as the dual of kernels. \medskip
    
    
    In abstract and linear algebra, given a morphism $f : A \to B$, we define $\ker f$ as follows:
    \[
        \ker f \triangleq \{ a \in B \mid f(a) = 0 \}.
    \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{(Co)kernels in Category Theory II}
    Of course we're not allowed to defined kernels as sets, but only as objects or morphisms.
    An elementary property of $\ker f$ is that $\ker f$ is subordinate to $A$, hence
    there exists a natural injection map $\iota : \ker f \to A$ such that:

    \[\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
        {\ker f} \& A \& B
        \arrow["\iota", hook, from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["f", from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \end{tikzcd}, \qquad f \circ \iota = 0_{AB}. \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{(Co)kernels in Category Theory III}
    It is then natural to define the kernel of $f : A \to B$ as the ``biggest morphism $k$''
    that annihilates $f$. \medskip

    \begin{definition}
        Let $f : A \to B$ be a morphism. Then a kernel $k$ of $f$ is a morphism
        $k : K \to A$ such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $f \circ k = 0_{KB}$,
            \item If $k' : K' \to A$ is a morphism such that $f \circ k' = 0_{K'B}$, then
                there exists a unique morphism $\iota_{K'} : K' \to K$ such that
                $k' = k \circ \iota_{K'}$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{(Co)kernels in Category Theory IV}
    Dually, a cokernel of $f : A \to B$ is the ``smallest morphism $j$'' that
    $f$ annihilates. \medskip

    \begin{definition}
        Let $f : A \to B$ be a morphism. Then a cokernel $j$ of $f$ is a morphism
        $j : B \to J$ such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $j \circ f = 0_{AJ}$,
            \item If $j' : B \to J'$ is a morphism such that $j' \circ f = 0_{AJ'}$, then
                there exists a unique morphism $\pi_{J'} : J \to J'$ such that
                $j' = \pi_{J'} \circ j$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{(Co)kernels Are Unique up to Isomorphism}
    \frametitle{(Co)kernels Are Unique up to Isomorphism I}

    have the desidered property of being ``unique'' and can always be thought
    of being the same object. \medskip

\begin{frame}{Pre-abelian Categories}
    \begin{definition}
        A pre-additive category is pre-abelian if it allows kernels and cokernels for
        every morphism $f$ and permits products for a finite family of objects.
    \end{definition}

    Since a pre-abelian category allows products, it also implicitly allows
    coproduct, as we have shown earlier.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Monomorphisms as Kernels in Abelian Categories}
    We're missing just one piece to get to the definition of an abelian category.
    When we looked at the morphism $\iota : \ker f \to A$ in the context of linear
    algebra, we generalised $\iota$ thinking of it an ``immersion'', namely an
    injective function. \medskip

    The opposite is also true for abelian groups, vector spaces and
    modules: an injective linear map gives always rise
    to a kernel.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Normal Monomorphisms and Conormal Epimorphisms}
    In our categorical framework, this will translate to the following
    definition: \medskip

    \begin{definition}
        A monomorphism is said \textbf{normal} if it's a kernel of a morphism.
        An epimorphism is said \textbf{conormal} if it's a cokernel of a morphism.
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definition of an Abelian Category}
    \begin{definition}
        An abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which all monomorphisms are normal
        and all epimorphisms are conormal.
    \end{definition}

    Summing up, an abelian category is a category $\mathcal{C}$ such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The hom-sets of $\mathcal{C}$ are abelian groups in a way such that
            composition is respected;
        \item $\mathcal{C}$ allows for products and coproducts of finite families of objects, and
            they are the same;
        \item Each morphism $f : A \to B$ has a kernel and a cokernel;
        \item Each monomorphism is a kernel of a morphism;
        \item Each epimorphism is a cokernel of another morphism.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Fundamental Results on Abelian Categories}

\begin{frame}{Bimorphisms}
    In this final section of the presentation, we illustrate
    two fundamental results about abelian categories, which
    motivate even more their existance. \medskip
    
    Before starting out, let's
    define what a \textbf{bimorphism} is:

    \begin{definition}[Bimorphism]
        Given a category $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism
        $f : A \to B$ which is both monic and epic is
        called a bimorphism. 
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bimorphisms are Isomorphisms in Abelian Categories}
    \frametitle{Bimorphisms are Isomorphisms in Abelian Categories I}

    In a general category, bimorphisms and isomorphisms do not
    coincide. For example, in $\cat{Mon}$, $\iota : \NN \to \ZZ$
    is a bimorphism, even though $\NN \not\cong \ZZ$. \medskip

    This is not the case for abelian categories:
    \begin{theorem}
        Given an abelian category $\mathcal{C}$, bimorphisms are
        always isomorphisms.
    \end{theorem}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof that Bimorphisms are Isomorphisms in Abelian Categories}
    \frametitle{%
        \only<1>{Bimorphisms are Isomorphisms in Abelian Categories II}%
        \only<2>{Bimorphisms are Isomorphisms in Abelian Categories III}%
        \only<3>{Bimorphisms are Isomorphisms in Abelian Categories IV}%
    }

    \begin{proof}
        \only<1>{
            Let $f : A \to B$ be a bimorphism. Then, since in $\mathcal{C}$
            all monomorphisms are normal, $f$ is the kernel of a morphism
            $g : B \to C$. \medskip


            Observe that
            \[ g \circ f = 0_{AC} = 0_{BC} \circ f. \]
            Since $f$ is an epimorphism, this implies that $g = 0_{BC}$.
        }

        \only<2>{
            Then $\id_B : B \to B$ is a kernel of $g$ as well: \medskip

            \begin{itemize}
                \item $g \circ \id_B = 0_{BC} \circ \id_B = 0_{BC}$,
                \item If $k' : K' \to B$ is a kernel of $g$, then
                    the only morphism $k$ satisfying $k' = \id_B \circ k$
                    is $k'$ itself, hence it is unique.
            \end{itemize}
        }

        \only<3>{
            Since $f : A \to B$ and $\id_B : B \to B$ are both kernels of the
            same morphism, the morphism $p : A \to B$ connecting $f$
            to $\id_B$ is an isomorphism (see Proposition \ref{prop:kernels_unique_up_to_iso}).
            Since $p = \id_B \circ f = f$, this
            concludes the proof.
        }

        \alt<3>{\qedhere}{\phantom\qedhere}
    \end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Freyd-Mitchell Embedding Theorem I}
    One the most important results about abelian categories states
    that each small abelian category is a full subcategory of
    $\cat{RMod}$, for a certain ring $R$. \medskip

    \begin{theorem}[Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem]
        Each small abelian category admits a full, faithful and exact
        functor to $\cat{RMod}$, for a certain ring.
    \end{theorem}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Freyd-Mitchell Embedding Theorem II}
    The Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem allows to study all small
    abelian categories in a concrete and well-studied setting, that
    of $R$-modules, with the most advanced algebraic tools. \medskip

    This also heavily connects abelian groups and $R$-modules in general,
    giving an insight of how deep the link between these two
    algebraic structures is.
